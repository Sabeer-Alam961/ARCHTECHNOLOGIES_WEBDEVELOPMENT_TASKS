# ARCH Technologies — Web Development Tasks

📁 **Repository:** ARCHTECHNOLOGIES_WEBDEVELOPMENT_TASKS

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of web development task folders and exercises for ARCH Technologies. Each task is a self-contained project (static sites, small apps, or exercises) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Contents
- [TASK 1 - PERSONAL PORTFOLIO](./TASK%201-PERSONAL%20PORTFOLIO/README.md)
  - A one-page portfolio with responsive design.
- [TASK 2 - TO-DO LIST](./TASK%202-TO-DO-LIST/README.md)
  - A persistent To-Do List application with Node.js backend.

## Purpose
- Centralize practice and task submissions for the web development curriculum.
- Provide consistent structure and documentation for each task.

## Conventions
- Each task folder should include:
  - `index.html` — main entry point
  - `styles.css` — styles
  - `script.js` — JavaScript (if needed)
  - `README.md` — task-specific instructions, demo, and notes
- Use semantic HTML, accessible markup (alt attributes, roles), and responsive styles.

## How to Use
1. Open a task folder in your editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. Run a local static server or use Live Server to preview pages.
3. Update or add your work in a new task folder following the structure above.

## Development Tips
- Keep commits small and descriptive (e.g., `task1: add responsive header`)
- When adding images, place them in an `assets/` or `images/` subfolder.
- Include a screenshot in the task `README.md` for quick previews.

## Contribution & Submission
- Add or update tasks directly in this repository.
- If using Git/GitHub, push changes to a branch and open a pull request for review.
