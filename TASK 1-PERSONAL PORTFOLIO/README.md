## Project Structure 📁
```
index.html       # Main HTML file

## Getting Started 🚀
### Prerequisites
No build tools required—this is a static site. Optional tools for development:
- VS Code (recommended)
- Live Server extension (for auto-reloading)
- Node.js (optional, for using small static servers)

### Run locally
1. Clone the repository or copy the files to a folder.
2. Preview by opening `index.html` in your browser.

Alternative: Run a simple HTTP server (recommended for testing features that require a server)
- Python 3: `py -3 -m http.server 8000` (Windows) or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Node: `npx serve .` (requires Node.js)
- Live Server (VS Code): Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"

Then open http://localhost:8000 (or the port shown) in your browser.

## Development 🔧
- Edit content in `index.html`.
- Update styling in `styles.css`.
- Add or modify interactivity in `script.js`.
- Keep markup semantic and accessible; add `alt` attributes to images and ensure color contrast.

## Deployment 📤
You can deploy this static site to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting provider.
- GitHub Pages: Push to a repository and enable Pages for the `main` branch (or use `gh-pages` branch)
- Netlify / Vercel: Drag-and-drop or connect your repo for automatic deploys.

## Customizing the site 🎨
- Replace placeholder text and images with your content.
- Adjust colors in `styles.css` to match your branding.
- Add new sections by copying the HTML structure and updating CSS.
